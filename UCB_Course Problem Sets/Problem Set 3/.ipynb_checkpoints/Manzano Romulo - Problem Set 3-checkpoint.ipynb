    "g. Suppose that you had not run the regression in part (f). Instead, you speak with a colleague to learn about heterogenous treatment effects. This colleague has access to a non-anonymized version of the same dataset and reports that he had looked at heterogenous effects of the ZMapp treatment by each of 10,000 different covariates to examine whether each predicted the effectiveness of ZMapp on each of 2,000 different indicators of health, for 20,000,000 different regressions in total. Across these 20,000,000 regressions your colleague ran, the treatment's interaction with gender on the outcome of temperature is the only heterogenous treatment effect that he found to be statistically significant. He reasons that this shows the importance of gender for understanding the effectiveness of the drug, because nothing else seemed to indicate why it worked. Bolstering his confidence, after looking at the data, he also returned to his medical textbooks and built a theory about why ZMapp interacts with processes only present in men to cure. Another doctor, unfamiliar with the data, hears his theory and finds it plausible. How likely do you think it is ZMapp works especially well for curing Ebola in men, and why?
