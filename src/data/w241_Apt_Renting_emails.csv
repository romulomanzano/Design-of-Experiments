[image: Inbox by Gmail] <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCo3zZ0P4vU>
Where can I use Inbox?

Inbox works best if you use it everywhere you check your email. Inbox is
available on the web at inbox.google.com, on Google Play and on the App
Store.

<https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.inbox&referrer=utm_source%3Demail_welcome>[image:
App Store]
<https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id905060486?pt=9008&ct=web_mrkt&mt=8>
How do I add a Reminder?

Tap the red create button in the bottom right and then tap the blue
Reminder icon.
Can I still use Inbox & Gmail?

Of course. All of your email is still in Gmail and always will be, but
Inbox works best if you go all in.
Can I file feedback?

Yes, please. Open the menu and scroll to the bottom of your labels. Tap
“Help & Feedback” and let us know what you think. If you’re interested in
giving in-person feedback, sign-up to be interviewed
<http://www.google.com/usability/index.html?reserved=0&pType=0&productTag=gmai_inbx&campaignType=gem&campaignDate=may15&labelTag=0>
in future user studies.
Is Inbox going to replace Gmail?

Don’t worry, Gmail isn’t going anywhere. Inbox is a new experience designed
and developed alongside Gmail.
Where can I learn more?

19,"Hi Bernie!

We're available to show the apartment Sunday after 4pm or just about
anytime next week. Does anywhere in there work for you?

We're on West 80th Street, between Amsterdam & Columbus. The apartment
definitely has plenty of space for 2 people, and is perfect for a couple!

Best,

[image: Inbox by Gmail] <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCo3zZ0P4vU>
Where can I use Inbox?

Inbox works best if you use it everywhere you check your email. Inbox is
available on the web at inbox.google.com, on Google Play and on the App
Store.
[image: Play Store]

How do I add a Reminder?

Tap the red create button in the bottom right and then tap the blue
Reminder icon.
Can I still use Inbox & Gmail?

Of course. All of your email is still in Gmail and always will be, but
Inbox works best if you go all in.
Can I file feedback?

Yes, please. Open the menu and scroll to the bottom of your labels. Tap
“Help & Feedback” and let us know what you think. If you’re interested in
giving in-person feedback, sign-up to be interviewed

in future user studies.
Is Inbox going to replace Gmail?

Don’t worry, Gmail isn’t going anywhere. Inbox is a new experience designed
and developed alongside Gmail.
Where can I learn more?

Check out our Help Center <https://support.google.com/inbox/?p=welcome> to

Thank you for inquiring in my listing.

When is your move in date?
Will you be rooming with others?
Are you looking for a true 2 bedroom or are you open to a convertible?
What is your overall budget you're trying to stay under?
What time would you like to come in and view some units?
