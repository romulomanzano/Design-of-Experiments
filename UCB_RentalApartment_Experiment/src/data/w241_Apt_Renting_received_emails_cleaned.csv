I apologize for the delay. We are now working with a broker. The price of
the apartment has dropped to $3,500 but there is now a broker fee. The
lease runs until July 31, 2018. If you are still interested, I will send
you our broker's contact info!

Thanks.

We're available to show the apartment Sunday after 4pm or just about
anytime next week. Does anywhere in there work for you?

We're on West 80th Street, between Amsterdam & Columbus. The apartment
definitely has plenty of space for 2 people, and is perfect for a couple!

I can show the apt today at 4pm.


Move in date?
Are you working/studying?
Good credit?
Do you guys make 40X the rent or are you using a guarantor?


Please advise,

Thank you

Hi Bernie,

We are currently out of town for Thanksgiving, but we will be back on Monday. Does a time early next week work for you to view the apartment?

I can also send you a video walkthrough, if you would like.

Thank you,

Where can I use Inbox?

Inbox works best if you use it everywhere you check your email. Inbox is
available on the web at inbox.google.com, on Google Play and on the App
Store.

Reminder icon.
Can I still use Inbox & Gmail?

Of course. All of your email is still in Gmail and always will be, but
Inbox works best if you go all in.
Can I file feedback?

Yes, please. Open the menu and scroll to the bottom of your labels. Tap
âHelp & Feedbackâ and let us know what you think. If youâre interested in
giving in-person feedback, sign-up to be interviewed

Is Inbox going to replace Gmail?

Donât worry, Gmail isnât going anywhere. Inbox is a new experience designed
and developed alongside Gmail.
Where can I learn more?

210,28,"Hello Alejandro,

Thank you for your interest, in fact the building just lowered the prices
since I posted this ad.  During the winter months they will
increase concessions to get the occupancy up.  This is a No Broker Fee
luxury rental and they are offering 1 Month FREE. The building is very
flexible, they require the tenant to make 40X the rent and have good
credit.

Gross rent is $5,750 with the One Free month it nets to $4,792.

Can you tell me the below?

What is your current situation?
Where do you live now?
Where are you focusing your search?
When is your move in date?
Do you have any pets?
What price point would you like to stay below?

I'll look forward to hearing from you soon!  Are your free for a scheduled
viewing for Today at 5 PM?  Let me know when works for you

lease expires!

Thank you very much for responding to my listing.

So that I may better serve you and get you the best unit, please provide me
with your current contact information of email and best phone/text.

Also, please answer the following -

When is your move in date?
Will the unit be just for you and your wife?
Are you looking for true bedrooms or are you open to a convertible?
What is your overall budget you're trying to stay under?

In your email to me, you asked when i am available to schedule a viewing.
I am very flexible.  It can be anytime.  Let me know your availability and
I will work around your schedule.

What about today or evening?

Best,
Beth

This apartment is no longer available. There is another 2BR with a terrace
for $6495 or $6150 without a terrace. Same finishes and amenities.

Would you be interested in viewing either of those? If so, what time would
you be available tomorrow?

[image: Inbox by Gmail] <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCo3zZ0P4vU>
Where can I use Inbox?

Inbox works best if you use it everywhere you check your email. Inbox is
available on the web at inbox.google.com, on Google Play and on the App
Store.
[image: Play Store]
<https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.inbox&referrer=utm_source%3Demail_welcome>[image:

How do I add a Reminder?

Tap the red create button in the bottom right and then tap the blue
Reminder icon.
Can I still use Inbox & Gmail?

Of course. All of your email is still in Gmail and always will be, but
Inbox works best if you go all in.
Can I file feedback?

Yes, please. Open the menu and scroll to the bottom of your labels. Tap
âHelp & Feedbackâ and let us know what you think. If youâre interested in
giving in-person feedback, sign-up to be interviewed

Is Inbox going to replace Gmail?

Donât worry, Gmail isnât going anywhere. Inbox is a new experience designed
and developed alongside Gmail.
Where can I learn more?
