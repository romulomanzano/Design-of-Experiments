**Abstract**

This experiment demonstrated evidence that thereâ€™s discrimination in the Craigslist Manhattan apartment rentals market. Listers were randomly assigned to the different treatment groups, blocked by neighborhoods. Subjects in the treatment groups were emailed by prospective tenants that had a Hispanic name, a newborn child, or both, while subjects in the control group were contacted by a white and childless tenant. The prospective tenants who were either hispanic or had a newborn child were less likely to receive a response than their white and childless counterparts. The control group saw a 20% high response rate, on average.

**Technical features**
